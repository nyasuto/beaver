## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Create a Public Issue

Please do not create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This could expose the vulnerability to malicious actors.

### 2. Report Privately

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following methods:

- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Create a private security advisory on this repository
- **Email**: Send details to [security@beaver.dev](mailto:security@beaver.dev)
- **Direct Message**: Contact the maintainers directly through secure channels

### 3. Include Details

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish with this vulnerability?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Fix Suggestions**: If you have ideas for fixing the vulnerability
- **Contact Information**: How we can reach you for follow-up questions

### 4. Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security vulnerability reports within:

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Assessment of the vulnerability
- **7 days**: Fix or mitigation plan
- **30 days**: Public disclosure (if appropriate)

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- Always use the latest versions of dependencies
- Run `npm audit` regularly to check for vulnerabilities
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all external communications

### For Deployments

- Keep the deployment environment updated
- Use strong authentication and authorization
- Monitor for security incidents
- Regular security audits
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use content security policies (CSP)

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow a responsible disclosure policy:

1. **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately
2. **Assessment**: We assess the vulnerability and develop a fix
3. **Fix Release**: We release a fix in a timely manner
4. **Public Disclosure**: We publicly disclose the vulnerability after a fix is available
5. **Credit**: We give credit to the reporter (if desired)

### Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1**: Acknowledgment sent
- **Day 3**: Assessment complete
- **Day 7**: Fix developed and tested
- **Day 14**: Fix released
- **Day 30**: Public disclosure
